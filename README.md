## Professional Summary

Self-reliant problem solver and permanent learner with 19 years of software development experience. I work well both independently and as part of a team, often becoming the go-to person for tackling challenging technical problems. I value gradual improvement over big rewrites and believe that clean code, automated testing, code reviews, and CI/CD are crucial for high-quality software development. Most importantly, I focus on delivering real value to users and businesses.
